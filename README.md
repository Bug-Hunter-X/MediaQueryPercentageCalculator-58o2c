# CSS calc() Issue in Media Queries

This repository demonstrates a bug where the `calc()` function in CSS doesn't produce the expected results when used with percentages within a `@media` query. The expected layout is not achieved due to an unexpected calculation.

The `mediaQueryCalcBug.css` file contains the problematic code.  The solution is provided in `mediaQueryCalcSolution.css`.
