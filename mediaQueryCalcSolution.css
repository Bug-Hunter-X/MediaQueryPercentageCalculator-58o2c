/* Instead of relying on percentage calculations within calc() in the media query,
   use explicit pixel values or viewport units (vw, vh) for more reliable results.
   This avoids potential calculation errors associated with percentage-based calculations
   within media queries, which might be interpreted differently by different browsers. */
